The first line contains the following data:

	k v N t

Where
	k = not relevant
	v = with this number of paths, all vertices can be visited
	N = number of vertices
	t = not relevant


The next line contains the following data:

        D Q

Where
	D = not relevant (in many files this number is missing)
	Q = not relevant


The remaining lines contain the data of each point. 
For each point, the line contains the following data:

	i x y d S f a list O C

Where
	i = vertex number
	x = x coordinate
	y = y coordinate
	d = service duration or visiting time	
	S = profit of the location
	f = not relevant
	a = not relevant
	list = not relevant (length of the list depends on a)
        O = opening of time window (earliest time for start of service)
	C = closing of time window (latest time for start of service)

* REMARKS *
	- The first point (index 0) is the starting AND ending point.
	- The number of vehicles considered for each instance makes it possible to visit all the customers. 
	- Since it is possible to visit all customers, the optimal solution for these instances is known: it is equal to the sum of all customer profits.
	- The time budget per path (Tmax) equals the closing time of the starting point.
	- The Euclidean distance is used and rounded down to the first decimal for the Solomon instances 
		and to the second decimal for the instances of Cordeau et al.
